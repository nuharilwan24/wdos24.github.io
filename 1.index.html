Sea turtle hatcheries on Sri Lanka's western coast frequently see a sizable number of them. The sea turtles travel to the hatcheries during their molting cycle by swimming through the vast Indian Ocean.<br><br><br>The Galle Sea Turtle Hatchery of Sri Lanka was founded about 40 years ago to safeguard these regular visitors to the Galle Sea shore. Sea turtles and other globally endangered species can be found in Sri Lanka. The western and southern shores of Sri Lanka frequently have sea turtle hatcheries. When female sea turtles return to their nesting areas to lay their eggs is the ideal time to visit a sea turtle hatchery. These sea turtles will be in a trance-like state throughout this time and won't be frightened by observers.</p></td>
